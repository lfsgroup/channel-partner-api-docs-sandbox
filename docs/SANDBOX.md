# Sandbox environment

## Details

* Base URL: https://papi.au.sandbox.getfeewise.com
* API spec running on sandbox: https://papi.au.sandbox.getfeewise.com/partner/docs/openapi

## Limitations
* The platform neither accepts real transactions nor deals with real money.
* Data is frequently reset - this will mean data such as invoices, webhook registrations etc will be lost. It is recommended to script any setup needed.
* Code version changes happen as needed by the development team.

Reasonable effort is made to keep this environment stable and working, however, it is not under production support.
Every attempt will be made to notify users of changes, resets etc but that cannot be guaranteed.
