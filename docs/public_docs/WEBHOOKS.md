# Webhooks

## Overview
Use webhook subscriptions to receive events that occur in the system (eg [payments](PAYMENT_EVENTS.md) and [payouts](PAYOUT_EVENTS.md)).

Partners that subscribe to events will receive event notifications, as HTTP POSTs, to the URL specified in the subscription.

## Event Subscriptions
Subscriptions can be managed using the webhook endpoints (below).

* [create webhook](reference/partner-openapispec.yaml/paths/~1api~1v3~1partner~1webhooks/post)
* [update webhook](reference/partner-openapispec.yaml/paths/~1api~1v3~1partner~1webhooks/put)
* [delete webhook](reference/partner-openapispec.yaml/paths/~1api~1v3~1partner~1webhooks/delete)
* [list webhooks](reference/partner-openapispec.yaml/paths/~1api~1v3~1partner~1webhooks/get)

A GET request to [webhooks endpoint](reference/partner-openapispec.yaml/paths/~1api~1v3~1partner~1events~1topics/get) will return a list of available events, which are also listed below.

### Available Events

Using the [create webhook](reference/partner-openapispec.yaml/paths/~1api~1v3~1partner~1webhooks/post) endpoint, you may subscribe to any of the below events.

```yaml json_schema
$ref: ../reference/partner-openapispec.yaml#/components/schemas/WebhookEventType
```


## Event Ordering
Order of events
FeeWise cannot guarantee delivery of events in the order in which they are generated. 
It is possible (however rare) that you may receive some events out of order. See [here](https://www.svix.com/blog/guaranteeing-webhook-ordering/) for more details.


## Event management / Correlation / Tracing
It is recommended that you set the `x-correlation-id` header on all API requests. 

If supplied, the `x-correlation-id` header will:
  * Be returned in all API responses (including webhook events) that were triggered by the client. 
  * allow clients to filter or ignore webhook events that your system has already processed.
  * allow easier resolution of issues between the client and server(s).

If `NOT` supplied, `x-correlation-id` will be generated by FeeWise and returned in all responses.
